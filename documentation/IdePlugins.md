# IDE Plugins

## VSCode

The source for this plugin is in [here](../ocean-language-support/vscode).

This plugin has syntax highlighting for Ocean files (.sea) and Hydro files (.h2o)

## Intellij IDEA

I have not implemented this yet but will need to since I moved my development to Intellij recently

## VIM/Emacs

I want to get more used to developing in these.
